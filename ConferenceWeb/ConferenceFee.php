        The registration fee is based on the status of the attendee. If the attendee is a student then the registration fee is lower than the regular registration. If a person or group of authors who have two or more papers to present on a particular conference, then the second paper will receive 50% discount of registration fee. For example, if regular registration fee is $600, then the second paper requires only $300 for the registration.
