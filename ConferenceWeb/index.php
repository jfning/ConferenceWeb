        World Congress CS-IT Conferences in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing website. This years event will be composed of research presentations, keynote lectures, invited presentations, tutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations. In recent past, keynote/tutorial/panel speakers have included: Prof. David A. Patterson (pioneer, architecture, U. of California, Berkeley), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (known as Father of Nanotechnology), Prof. John H. Holland (known as Father of Genetic Algorithms; U. of Michigan), Prof. Ian Foster (known as Father of Grid Computing; U. of Chicago &amp; ANL)

        An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers, developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."

        One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives; i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.

        You are invited to submit a paper for consideration. All accepted papers will be published in printed conference books/proceedings (ISBN) and will also be made available online. The proceedings will be indexed in science citation databases that track citation frequency/data for each paper. In addition, like prior years, extended versions of selected papers (about 35%) will appear in journals and edited research books (publishers include: Springer, Elsevier, BMC, and others).
